# SpatialOrientationTask
It is a unity project (5.6.0f3 or higher). You can directly run the "PerspectiveTakingTest" scene to do the test. If you want to build it, you need to change two lines of code in the "SwitchSOTQuestions" script:
1) uncomment Line 69, comment Line 70; 
2) uncomment Line 236, comment Line 237.

The time list of the test is set to 7 min. However, the original time limit should be 5 min. Feel free to adjust that using a public variable.
